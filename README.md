\# Detecting Structural Breaks via the Fused Lasso



\## Methodology



This repository implements the fused lasso approach for structural break detection in time series, as developed in our paper. The method provides a robust framework for identifying multiple structural breaks in economic and financial time series.



\### Mathematical Foundation



The fused lasso estimator solves the following optimization problem:
